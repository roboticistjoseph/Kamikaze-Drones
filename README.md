## Introduction
  
  Our team will be using ‘Kamikaze Drones’ as the project code name to help protect Acme’s secret product plans. The name means ‘Divine Wind’ in Japanese and is inspired from the ‘[Kamikaze swarm operation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d28APIfwSI)’ by company ‘STM’.

  In this proposal, our team has focused on implementing one of the trending applications of swarm drones, which is to form different geometric shapes using a swarm of 20 or more drones.

  In order to achieve this, state-of-art path-planning swarm algorithms will be deployed. The performance validation of this project will be done using the Gazebo simulation depicting a real-time demo of the application. Acme can then utilize this package in its 5-year robotics-based product roadmap.

## System Design

### Development methodology

  Agile software development model will be used for the development process where tasks will be tracked using a backlog table. The software is designed in a Test-Driven Development fashion and implemented using Pair programming technique. The tasks will be outlined for every sprint and after each sprint, the roles of the pair-programming group will be interchanged.

## Development process
  - Using the Software Engineering Practices, all design and development work was followed Agile Iterative Process (AIP) where product backlog, iteration backlog, and work log were maintained usign appropriate measure. The Sheet can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BQCqN5Qy6YmZE76j3XB-w8Y3W8QGNNPGS1bdCdOAWbg/edit#gid=0)
  - Each sprint's notes and reviews have been documented [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rGsBwGwRbpP7cR_gu-ueWbK_iysQTQdyqjFzTM7u1lA/edit?usp=sharing)
  
### System architecture

## Clone, Build and Run the Simulation

### Source
```
# overlay
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
```

### Clone
```
git clone https://github.com/roboticistjoseph/Kamikaze-Robots.git
```

### Build files
```
# fresh build of packages
cd Kamikaze-Robots/
colcon build --packages-select box_bot_description/
colcon build --packages-select box_bot_gazebo/
colcon build --packages-select kamikaze/
```

### Removing previous builds (*Optional*)
If build fails, re-run the above build commands after following the one's below.
```
cd ~/Kamikaze-Robots/
# remove any existing build files
rm -rf build/box_bot_description/
rm -rf build/box_bot_gazebo/
rm -rf build/kamikaze/
```

### Run the Simulation
Run the below commands in two different terminals
```
# underlay
source install/local_setup.bash

# Spawn 20 Bots in gazebo
ros2 launch box_bot_gazebo multi_box_bot_launch.py
```
```
# underlay
source install/local_setup.bash

# Control the formation of spawned Bots
ros2 launch kamikaze swarm_controller
```

# Developer Section
## Build Test Coverage
```
cd ~/Kamikaze-Robots/
# remove any existing build files
rm -rf build/box_bot_description/
rm -rf build/box_bot_gazebo/
rm -rf build/kamikaze/

# build with coverage
colcon build --cmake-args -DCOVERAGE=1 --packages-select box_bot_description
colcon build --cmake-args -DCOVERAGE=1 --packages-select box_bot_gazebo
colcon build --cmake-args -DCOVERAGE=1 --packages-select kamikaze

# to check log (example)
cat log/latest_build/kamikaze/stdout_stderr.log
```

### Run Tests
- In a new terminal, run the follwoing commands to Test the functionality of the cloned software.
```
cd ~/Kamikaze-Robots/
source install/setup.bash
colcon test --packages-select kamikaze
cat log/latest_test/kamikaze/stdout_stderr.log
```

## Code Analysis
Running 'cpplint' and 'cppcheck' to check for coding style and detect bugs.
### cpplint
Change to the root directory of the package, ```/TurtleBot3-Roomba```, and run:
```
cpplint --filter=-build/c++11,+build/c++17,-build/namespaces,-build/include_order ./src/*.cpp ./include/*.hpp > ./results/cpplint.txt
```
The results of running ```cpplint``` can be found in ```/results/cpplint.txt```.

### cppcheck
Change to the root directory of the package, ```/TurtleBot3-Roomba```, and run:
```
cppcheck --enable=all --std=c++17 ./src/*.cpp ./include/*.hpp --suppress=missingIncludeSystem --suppress=unmatchedSuppression --suppress=unusedFunction --suppress=missingInclude --suppress=useInitializationList > results/cppcheck.txt
```
The results of running ```cppcheck``` can be found in ```/results/cppcheck.txt```.
